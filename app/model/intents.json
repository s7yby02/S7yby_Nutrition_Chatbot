Each food is assigned a specific number of SmartPoints, which is determined based on its nutritional value. Members are also assigned a daily budget of SmartPoints based on factors like their height, weight, and activity level. WW is one of the most flexible commercial weight loss programs available. No foods are completely off-limits, and you can still enjoy many of your favorite foods, as long as they fit within your daily SmartPoints budget. Plus, research shows that it can be effective for long-term weight loss. According to one review of 39 studies, participants who followed WW for 12 months achieved at least 2.6% more weight loss, compared with both a control group and those who received basic nutritional education.

Minimally processed ingredients, including fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, and poultry, are encouraged. Meanwhile, foods like grains, legumes, dairy products, and added sugars are restricted. Paleo diets are often recommended for those hoping to fuel muscle growth. This is because many foods encouraged on the diet are high in protein, which can help increase muscle mass when paired with resistance training. Whatâ€™s more, studies show that the paleo diet can help improve body composition by decreasing body fat, reducing belly fat, and increasing weight loss.
